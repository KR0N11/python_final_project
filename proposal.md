## Project Description
This project aims to create an "Akinator" game, an interactive guessing game where the system predicts a character or object the user is thinking of based on a series of questions and answers. Using Baye's theroem probability and machine learning techniques, the game will adjust its questions based on previous user responses to efficiently narrow down the possibilities.

## Main Idea
The main concept is to implement a game similar to  Akinator while utilizing Bayes' Theorem to update probabilities based on user answers. The game will ask users yes/no or multiple-choice questions and use the answers to predict the most likely character or object the user is thinking of.

## Technologies
Python: For backend development, including the probability calculations and game logic.
Flask: To create a simple web interface for the game.
SQLite: For storing a database of characters, objects, and their attributes.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For creating an interactive front-end.
Git: For version control and regular commits.
